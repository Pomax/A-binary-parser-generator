The parser knows a relatively small language:

  string   A string of ascii characters
  name     <string>

  value    An integer number
           | <type>.<name>
           | <value> [+-*] <value>
           | HERE
           | START
           | REMAINDER

      The value HERE represents the current absolute offset in the file.

      The value START represents the absolute offset (in bytes) of the
      start of the collection it is used in.

      The value REMAINDER represents the unknown quantity that takes
      up the rest of the data in the datafile (GLOBAL) or collection (LOCAL)
      as of this point in the file. It can be used in arrays to indicate
      "as many as fit the rest of the file or collection".

  type     BYTE               8 bit value
           | ASCII            8 bit ascii value (expressly not called a 'char')
           | SHORT            16 bit signed integer
           | USHORT           16 bit unsigned integer
           | UINT24           24 bit unsigned integer
           | LONG             32 bit signed integer
           | ULONG            32 bit unsigned integer
           | <type>[<value>]  array notation
           | <collection name>  custom type (think "struct")
           | COLLECTION<<name>

      The COLLECTION<<name>> type indicates a block of data that conforms
      to the collection indicated by the value of <name>. For instance:

        ASCII[4] name
        COLLECTION<name> ihdr

      marks the ihdr record as being of a type indicated by the value of "name";
      if name is "IHDR" then ihdr will be a data block that should be interpreted
      using the Collection IHDR. This allows for specifications in which blocks
      are self-descriptive.


  record   RESERVED <type>
           | <type> <name>
           | (GLOBAL|LOCAL|IMMEDIATE)? <type> OFFSET <name> (TO <collection name>)? (RELATIVE TO <name>)?

      Sometimes specs have "reserved" data, which is a byte, short, etc. that
      basically acts as a spacer. These will be read and then discarded

      For offsets, we need an indicator that tells us whether it's:

        GLOBAL      relative to the start of this file
        LOCAL       relative to the start of this collection
        IMMEDIATE   relative to the next byte's position

      Or, if the offset is relative to another record, RELATIVE TO <name of that
      record, within scope>.

  comparator    any language-supported numerical comparator
  conditional   (<name> <comparator> <value>)
  conditioned   <conditional> { <collection body> }

      conditioned collection blocks let us generate parsers that can deal with
      multiple versions of data blocks (since specs tend to change over the years).

  collection name: <name>
  collection identifier: [Defining] Collection <collection name>

      There can only be one collection marked "Defining". This is the
      collection that is treated as the master collection representing
      the start of the binary data file, and its parse function will be
      bound to the Parser.parse(data) function for starting a parse run.

  collection: <collection identifier> { <collection body> }

  collection body: (record | collection | conditioned)*

      Collections can be empty, but if not they list records and possible "private"
      collections for use as "structs" in that collection. Any parent collection
      won't see it.

It has an even smaller set of functions and macros:

  VALUE(<name>)    Returns the value of the passed record
  TERMINATE        Will cause the generated parser to print the termination message, and
                   cancel the parsing process.
  WARN             Will cause a message to be generated, without terminating the parsing process.


The language also supports /* block comments */ as well as // line comments.

It'll generate JavaScript, for now, because it's a stupidly simple language to generate
code for. I'm sure any number of other target languages can be added later, because
honestly, it's not rocket science =)

This library will simply map the binary data to unpacked (as far as it knows how to)
data in memory, but without any traversal logic; it's simply a data unpacker. This
allows for data->XML or data->JSON unpacking, and probably also the reverse, provided
the information from the .spec file is kept ... somewhere...

The generated code operates on a data object that looks like this:

  {
    pointer: <number>   // should default to 0, indicates the current offset in the data
    marks: []           // an array for pointer save/restores
    bytecode: arraybuffer   // the data array
  }

For an example of a .spec file, have a look at "OpenType.spec"
